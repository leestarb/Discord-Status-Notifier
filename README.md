### What makes this bot special?

Status Notifier is coded with a fantastic new Discord Python API wrapper called [Dis-Snek](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/Dis-Snek). It is fun to make bots with and very intuitive. This bot will stand out as a proof of concept for this library. I plan to always keep this bot open source, just keep in mind if you want to self host this bot it will take some code change. A few things are tailored to my hosting setup.
